|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing	| 3 | A one spot solution to view the status of all your machines and take action prior to needs like increasing memory, resource updation, identifying power outage, etc. |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.	| 3 |  |
| Use of version control tools                                                                                                                                                            | 3 | Github was used. The team used different [branches](https://github.com/nakraft/CSC510/branches) for adding features which is a good practice.                                     |
|Test cases exist	| 0 | |
|Test cases are routinely executed	| 0 | No chat channel link provided. |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up	|3| Can be seen in [Contributing.md](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed	| 3 | |
|Chat channel: exists	| 3 | |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.	| 3 | Test coverage is good and and can be seen in [README](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files	| 3 | Can be seen by the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)		| 3 | Can be seen by the [contributions](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/pulse) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)		| 3 | Is evident by the issues resolved using same tools in [Pull Requests](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base		| 3 | Can be seen by the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) |
