|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing	| 3 | ss |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.	| 3 |  |
|Use of version control tools	| 3 | |
|Test cases exist	| 0 | No issues created.|
|Test cases are routinely executed	| 0 | No chat channel link provided. |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up	|3|  |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed	| 3 | |
|Chat channel: exists	| 3 | |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.	|  | |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files	| 3 | |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)		| 3 | |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)		| 3 | |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base		|  |
|Short release cycles |  3 |
