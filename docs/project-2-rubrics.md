The team used different [branches](https://github.com/nakraft/CSC510/branches) for adding features which is a good practice.                                     |
|Test cases exist	| 3 | [Tests](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/tree/main/tests) |
|Test cases are routinely executed	| 3 | Whenever there is a push the tests are executed by [build file](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up	|3| Can be seen in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) |

|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.	| 3 | Test coverage is good and and can be seen in [here](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files	| 3 | Can be seen by the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)|

|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)		| 3 | [vscode](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/tree/rubric/.vscode), [pre-commits](https://github.com/team-12-csc-510/amatsa/tree/rubric/.vscode) |
